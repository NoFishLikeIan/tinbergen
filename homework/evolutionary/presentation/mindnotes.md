### Guideline

The core questions that I hope you answer in the presentation are:

1.	What (evolutionary) theory is being tested? 
2.	What are the predictions of this theory? 
3.	How does the (experimental) setup allow one to test those? 

At point 2. and/or 3., it is possible that you disagree with the experimental approach in the paper. Maybe you disagree that this is the prediction of the theory, or you disagree with the conclusion the paper draws from their data. 

If the theory is corroborated, and the data line up with the prediction, then you can ask:

4.	How strong a corroboration is this? Would these data also line up with predictions from other theories, or would they reject those? 
If the data do not line up with the prediction, you can ask:
5.	How strong a rejection is this? Does that really imply that the theory is rejected altogether? Or can modified versions of the theory perhaps still explain the data? 

Please keep your presentations short, and focus on the essentials!


## Paper

### Understanding of goals and intentions

Ladder of cooperation and competition:

1. React to actions - mechanical
2. Develop set of behavioral rules based on experience 
3. Put yourself in their shoes and understand their intention (what state of the world do they want to bring about given the environment) - Theory of Mind


2 and 3 are in failure: do you understand goals or behavior? Evidence.

### Understanding of perception and knowledge

1. React to beliefs - mechanical
2. Adaptive learning of others behavior to determine beliefs
3. Being able to understand that there are different levels of knowledge and perception

Experiments, when competing for foods, chimps take into account what the competitor can and cannot see. Even influencing what the other person can or cannot see. Evidence.

### Understanding false beliefs

Predicting what the other will do given that he has false beliefs. "Results showed that although chimpanzees distinguished between the informed and uninformed conditions (thus showing an understanding of their competitorâ€™s knowledge versus ignorance), they did not distinguish between the uninformed and the misinformed conditions (thus providing no evidence for understanding that their competitor had a false belief)."
