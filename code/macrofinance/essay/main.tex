\section{Introduction}

In developing countries central banks' independence and operability are often taken for granted. Rarely are issues of credibility or financial stability of monetary institutions discussed. Nevertheless, the ``new-style'' central banking (i.e. unconventional monetary policy) calls for a perusal of the banks' balance sheet and the interplay between its financing and its objectives.

The financial crisis of 2008 and the ongoing pandemic economic crisis will leave behind high levels of government debt across the world ($130\%$ world debt-to-GDP ratio according to the \cite{WEO2020}). This places economic and political pressure on central banks to alleviate the debt burden, brought about by necessary fiscal expansions, by means of accommodating monetary policy. Such pressure is commonly referred to as ``fiscal dominance''.

On the one hand, a period of fiscal dominance requires central banks to divert monetary tools towards lowering interest rates on government debt in the secondary market. This might undermine their independence and impede achieving the mandated price stability (\cite{Schnabel2020}). This aspect, albeit fundamental, is not the focus of this analysis. On the other, prologued fiscal dominance might shift financial instability from governments to central banks, deteriorating their capital. %FIXME: Schnabel is improperly cited

This essay analyses, using the relevant literature, the phenomenon and consequences of deteriorating and potentially negative central bank capital. % TODO: Finish this

\section{Financial stability of central banks}

\subsection{Definition capital and stability}

The financial position, hence the financial stability, of a central bank can be complicated to define. As \citein{Hall2015} point out, relying on conventional definitions applied to commercial banks is not helpful. First of all, the central bank liabilities (i.e. reserves and money issued) cannot be (further) liquidated since, in normal times, they are themselves the fundamental unit of liquidity. Second, the central bank mandate is that of price stability and not profit. This renders the notion of market value for a central bank unapplicable. Third and last, a sizeable and increasing share of the bank's assets is composed by assets of its sole shareholder (i.e. government debt). These structural aspects distort incentives which are present in commercial banking, thereby rendering financial theory around bank solvency and profitability irrelevant.

One needs then to focus on the actual (i.e. those that pose a real resource constraint on its operations) obligations a central bank faces. The bank is \textit{de facto} an independent arm of the government, to which it owes (or is owed) dividends following an implicit dividend rule. The central bank can always meet its obligation towards the government by issuing reserves but in doing so, if the path of reserve issuance is ``explosive'', it loses its independence and ability to fulfill its mandate. % FIXME: Rephrase this

Hence, hereafter central bank insolvency will be understood as the unwillingness of agents to hold its liabilities (i.e. currency) as a consequence of an unstable path of reserve issuance. In a theoretical model this is manifest in hyperinflation, namely $p \xrightarrow{} \infty$, and historically this was followed by a flight to other currencies or the emergence, by political institution or private competition, of a new monetary institution (\cite{Flandreau2007}). %FIXME: Find a better reference

\subsection{Dividend rules}

Given what we have seen in the previous section, the driving force behind central bank solvency and insolvency is its dividend rule. Namely, a bank loses independence and solvency if its dividend rule requires a negative and unstable dividends path. Note that, given this definition a central bank can be solvent with negative capital (i.e. negative dividends) if not in an unstable path.

As noted by \citein{Hall2015}, in practice central banks pay dividends either following a \textit{mark-to-market} or a \textit{nominal net worth} rule. Both formulations are, in real terms, equivalent. Dividends are coupon payments from domestic and foreign assets (mostly government bonds), capital gains on such assets, and seigniorage profit net of interest payments on reserves. Such a rule has two major implications. First, negative dividends can arise only as a result of either impaired bond repayments, an appreciation of the real exchange rate, or capital losses. Second, if the dividend rule is constraint to one-period solvency and the central banks only holds domestic risk-free assets, dividends are equivalent to seigniorage revenues, hence cannot be negative.
