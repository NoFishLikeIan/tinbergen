\section{Introduction}

In developed countries central banks' independence and effectiveness are often taken for granted. Issues of credibility or financial stability of monetary institutions have taken a backseat in the discussion. Nevertheless, the ``new-style'' of central banking, which led to an inflation central banks' balance sheets, calls for a review of the interplay between its financing and its objectives (\cite{Hall2015}).

The financial crisis of 2008 and the ongoing pandemic economic crisis will leave behind high levels of government debt across the world (\cite{WEO2020}). This places economic and political pressure on central banks to alleviate the debt burden, brought about by necessary fiscal expansions, by means of accommodating monetary policy. Such pressure is commonly referred to as ``fiscal dominance''.

On the one hand, a period of fiscal dominance requires central banks to divert monetary tools towards lowering interest rates on government debt in the secondary market. This might undermine their independence and impede achieving the mandated price stability (\cite{FernandezAlbertos2015}). This aspect, albeit fundamental, is not the focus of this analysis. On the other hand, prologued fiscal dominance might shift financial instability from governments to central banks, deteriorating their capital.

This essay analyses the phenomenon and consequences of deteriorating and potentially negative central bank capital. The focus is on both domestic and international implications of financial instability of the monetary authority. Both issues are discussed from a theoretical and historical point of view. First, using a modern framework, I define financial stability of a monetary authority and discuss the domestic implications of negative capital. Second, I give a historical example of financial instability, the Bank of Amsterdam in the seventeenth century. Third, I present an extended theoretical framework, embedding the central bank in an international economy, and consider matters of international cooperation under financial instability. % TODO: Maybe also an historical account on cooperation: the Bank of France and England in the eighteenth century

\section{Financial stability of central banks}

\subsection{Central bank's instruments}

A central bank has two main channels through which it interacts with the economy, controlling currency and holding reserves. Furthermore, the bank commits to allow exchange between currency and reserves (informally depositing currency) at a fixed one-to-one rate, such that the two represent the unit of accounting in the economy. From this perspective, the central bank is a government monopolist that produces and sells currency and collects an inflation tax (seigniorage) on currency holders (\cite[p.~15]{Reis2016}).

In practice, central banks expand reserves by setting an interest rate, thereby inducing an inflation level, and after accommodate the demand for currency in the economy (\cite[p.~17]{Reis2016}). Framing the operations of a central bank this way implies that the institution can be seen as a bank raising revenue through seigniorage, with the government as sole shareholder, and depositor of reserves as debt holders. Therefore, insofar as reserves are backed by the government, the central bank solvency is equivalent to solvency of the overall government (\cite{Sims2001})


\subsection{Definition of capital and stability}

The financial position of a central bank can be complicated to define. As \citein{Hall2015} point out, relying on conventional definitions applied to commercial banks is not helpful. First of all, the central bank liabilities (i.e. reserves) cannot be liquidated since, in normal times, they are themselves the fundamental unit of liquidity. Second, the central bank mandate is that of price stability and not profit. This renders the notion of market value for a central bank inapplicable. Third and last, a sizeable and increasing share of the bank's assets is composed by assets of its sole shareholder (i.e. government debt). These structural aspects distort incentives which are present in commercial banking, thereby rendering financial theory around commercial bank's solvency and profitability irrelevant.

One needs then to focus on the actual (i.e. those that pose a real resource constraint on its operations) obligations a central bank faces. In normal times, the bank is \textit{de facto} an independent arm of the government, to which it owes (or is owed) dividends following an implicit dividend rule. The central bank can always meet its obligation towards the government by issuing reserves. Nevertheless, if the path of reserve issuance is ``explosive'', agents would be unwilling to hold reserves within the bank unless the government is expected to recapitalize the bank at some point in the future. Such expectations implicitly puts a strain on the independence of the bank from the government and the ability to fulfill its mandate (\cite{deHaan2016}).

Hence, hereafter central bank insolvency will be understood as the unwillingness of agents to deposit reserves or, equivalently, hold currency, as a consequence of an unstable path of reserve issuance. In a theoretical model this is manifested in hyperinflation and historically this was followed by a flight to other currencies or the emergence of a new monetary institution, either by political institution or private competition (\cite{Flandreau2007}). % FIXME: Find a better reference

\subsection{Dividend rules}

As we have seen in the previous section, the driving force behind central bank solvency is the relation between its liabilities and its dividends. In this context, negative dividends are a \textit{de facto} form of recapitalization. The recapitalization is necessary when the central bank is incapable of raising revenues via reserves. Namely, a bank loses independence, hence solvency, if its dividend rule requires a negative and unstable dividends path. Note that, given this definition, a central bank can be solvent with negative capital (i.e. negative dividends) if not on an unstable path.

As pointed out by \citein{Hall2015}, in practice central banks pay dividends either following a \textit{mark-to-market} or a \textit{nominal net worth} rule. Both formulations are, in real terms, equivalent: dividends are financed via coupon payments from domestic and foreign assets (mostly government bonds), capital gains on such assets, and seigniorage profit net of interest payments on reserves. Such rule has two major implications. First, negative dividends can arise only as a result of either impaired bond repayments, an appreciation of the real exchange rate, or capital losses. Second, if the dividend rule is constraint to one-period solvency and the central banks only holds domestic risk-free assets, dividends are equivalent to seigniorage revenues, hence cannot be negative.

\subsection{Negative capital}

Most central banks own foreign and/or risky debt, hence the possibility of negative dividends arises from one of the three channels mentioned above. Assuming no recapitalization, negative dividends need to be accounted for as deferred assets, namely central banks' future claim on its own future remittances to the Treasury, and their present value needs to be equal to the present value of subsequent positive dividends (\cite{Archer2013}).

\citein{Reis2015} proposes to use the size of these deferred assets as a measure of financial stability. The argument is that, in the limit, the present value of seigniorage, which is the only central bank's form of revenue impossible to lose, sets a threshold to the deferred assets account over which its independence is in doubt, since above this level a recapitalization is required at some point in the future. % Clarify that maximum positive dividends = pv seigniorage

Given this description it is perfectly possible for a central bank to run sustained negative capital, as long as the deferred assets account is lower than the present value of seigniorage. This result simply states that capital might as well be negative because it is not the core metric of a central bank's financial stability. Furthermore, it shows that to make a claim around solvency in the post-crisis period, it is necessary to focus on the effects of fiscal dominance on the present value of seigniorage and inflation expectation.

\subsection{Seigniorage}

As we have seen, the present value of seigniorage poses a natural limit to the deferred dividends the central bank can accumulate.

\section{International effect of fiscal dominance}

The analysis will rely on \citein{Caballero2016} and \citein{Cook2013} to understand the consequences of fiscal dominance and deteriorating central bank's balance sheets in an open (to capital and goods) economy. I will first lay down the main results of the model as presented by the authors and then consider the effects of introducing financially unstable central banks within the framework.
