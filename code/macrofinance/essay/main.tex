\section{Introduction}

In developing countries central banks' independence and operability are often taken for granted. Rarely are issues of credibility or financial stability of monetary institutions discussed. Nevertheless, the ``new-style'' central banking (i.e. unconventional monetary policy) calls for a perusal of the banks' balance sheet and the interplay between its financing and its objectives.

The financial crisis of 2008 and the ongoing pandemic economic crisis will leave behind high levels of government debt across the world ($130\%$ world debt-to-GDP ratio according to the \cite{WEO2020}). This places economic and political pressure on central banks to alleviate the debt burden, brought about by necessary fiscal expansions, by means of accommodating monetary policy. Such pressure is commonly referred to as ``fiscal dominance''.

On the one hand, a period of fiscal dominance requires central banks to divert monetary tools towards lowering interest rates on government debt in the secondary market. This might undermine their independence and impede achieving the mandated price stability (\cite{Schnabel2020}). This aspect, albeit fundamental, is not the focus of this analysis. On the other, prologued fiscal dominance might shift financial instability from governments to central banks, deteriorating their capital. %FIXME: Schnabel is improperly cited

This essay analyses, using the relevant literature, the phenomenon and consequences of deteriorating and potentially negative central bank capital. % TODO: Finish this
