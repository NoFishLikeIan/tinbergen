  abstract  = {In this paper, it is argued that the espousal of biological analogies by evolutionary economists cannot reveal the most important features of evolutionary change in economic processes. Analogies are used to best effect in the preliminary stages of research and in their normal linguistic role as illustrative devices in argumentation. An economic process may sometimes appear to operate ‘like’ a biological one; however, it is inappropriate to then model such a process ‘as if’ it is essentially biological due to its timeless qualities. Because of this timelessness, the model cannot address history except through the contrived use of Newtonian comparative statics, with the force of competition acting as the equilibrating mechanism. In contrast, the self-organization approach to system behaviour is founded upon an observable historical process, captured in the entropy law. It deals with non-equilibrium structural change, as found in historical experience, not timeless Newtonian comparative statics, workable only in contrived laboratory experiments. The advantage of the self-organization approach is that it encompasses time irreversibility, structural change and fundamental uncertainty in an analytical framework which can be used in empirical settings. The economic self-organization approach offers an analytical framework which can embrace a range of other positions. It can deal with Austrian considerations concerning the variety of subjective knowledge, aspiration and uncertainty and it can give spontaneous order an explicit process meaning. A wide range of institutionalist insights can be translated into propositions concerning self-organization. Marshallian neo-classical approximations concerning the short period operation of the price mechanism in certain market conditions can be dealt with. What we cannot incorporate is the post-Marshallian general equilibrium analysis which has become so popular in modern neoclassical economics. Neither can we embrace new Keynesian propositions concerning asymmetric information or incomplete markets. Thus, economic self-organization provides a modern context for the revitalization of older traditions in economics and political economy that stress the fact that nonlinear structural change is an ongoing feature of economic systems.},

  title       = {Causal Inference and Data-Fusion in Econometrics},
  abstract    = {Learning about cause and effect is arguably the main goal in applied econometrics. In practice, the validity of these causal inferences is contingent on a number of critical assumptions regarding the type of data that has been collected and the substantive knowledge that is available. For instance, unobserved confounding factors threaten the internal validity of estimates, data availability is often limited to non-random, selection-biased samples, causal effects need to be learned from surrogate experiments with imperfect compliance, and causal knowledge has to be extrapolated across structurally heterogeneous populations. A powerful causal inference framework is required to tackle these challenges, which plague most data analysis to varying degrees. Building on the structural approach to causality introduced by Haavelmo (1943) and the graph-theoretic framework proposed by Pearl (1995), the artificial intelligence (AI) literature has developed a wide array of techniques for causal learning that allow to leverage information from various imperfect, heterogeneous, and biased data sources (Bareinboim and Pearl, 2016). In this paper, we discuss recent advances in this literature that have the potential to contribute to econometric methodology along three dimensions. First, they provide a unified and comprehensive framework for causal inference, in which the aforementioned problems can be addressed in full generality. Second, due to their origin in AI, they come together with sound, efficient, and complete algorithmic criteria for automatization of the corresponding identification task. And third, because of the nonparametric description of structural models that graph-theoretic approaches build on, they combine the strengths of both structural econometrics as well as the potential outcomes framework, and thus offer a perfect middle ground between these two competing literature streams.},

We exploit cross-country variation in a long panel to identify age structure effects in inflation, controlling for standard monetary factors. A robust relationship emerges that accords with the lifecycle hypothesis. That is, inflationary pressure rises when the share of dependants increases and, conversely, subsides when the share of working age population increases. This relationship accounts for the bulk of trend inflation, for instance, about 7 percentage points of US disinflation since the 1980s. It predicts rising inflation over the coming decades.},
