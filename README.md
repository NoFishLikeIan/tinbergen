# A reading list for my MPhil at Tinbergen Institute

---

## Purpose

This is my reading list for stuff I am gonna read, mostly related to math and economics, during my Master. The structure and all should follow [my other reading list](https://github.com/NoFishLikeIan/read-this) so...
You might say:

> Use twitter like everybody you idiot - Random stranger

And I'd say, no. So let's get going.

## Structure

The structure should be as follows:

- [ ] [_Title with hyperlink to paper/blog_](https://example.com/) - Short description, _Personal thoughts_ / [_Extra hyperlinked material_](https://example.com)

## Reading list

### Courses

- [x] [_Logic for economists_](https://www.coursera.org/learn/logic-for-economists) - _Suggested course on logical foundation for economic reasoning_

- [x] [_Notes on function sequence convergence_](http://www.math.wisc.edu/~angenent/521.2017s/UniformConvergence.html) - _A series of notes to understand convergence_

- [ ] [_Ordinary differential equations_](https://users.math.msu.edu/users/gnagy/teaching/ode.pdf) - by Gabriel Nagy, _Good practice book for ODE_

### Papers

- [ ] [_Fiscal source of inflation_](https://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/john.cochrane/research/papers/decomposition.pdf) - This paper measures the fiscal roots of inflation, _This could be interesting in the scope of combining my thesis work (that focuses mostly on monetary policy and prices) to fiscal policy_

- [ ] [_The Complexity of Computing a Nash Equilibrium_](https://people.csail.mit.edu/costis/journal_ver10.pdf) - Is there a polynomial-time algorithm for computing Nash equilibria? And is this reliance on Brouwer inherent? _It is hard to compute for more than 2 players, that might be a problem for microeconomics, some hope in [gradient methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.12363)_

- [ ] [_The enduring link between demography and inflation_](https://ideas.repec.org/p/bis/biswps/722.html) - Are demographic shifts responsible for low inflation? _Could be, inflation pressure seems to rise as dependents share increases_

- [ ] [_Chaos in foreign exchange markets: a sceptical view_](http://centaur.reading.ac.uk/35988/1/35988.pdf) - Is there a (mathematically) chaotic behaviour in foreign exchange markets?

- [ ] [International Pollution Control: Cooperative versus Noncooperative Strategies](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069683710235?via%3Dihub) - Application of optimal control in pollution issues

### Collateral

- [ ] [_How I'm able to take notes in mathematics lectures using LaTeX and Vim_](https://castel.dev/post/lecture-notes-1/?fbclid=IwAR21DzEX7qMutxvM8AA5e41yNgYO_V5WTXvamR10L186J9pldb1DEr-_ZTQ) - _Guide on taking notes with Vim and LaTex, I could use this potentially_
