# Tinbergen ðŸ¦‰

The monorepo with all the code, papers, and miscellaneous for my Ph.D. in Economics. Feel free to take but please cite!

Divided in:

- `./code`: `Tex` files and code I play around with, mostly `Python` or `Julia`
- `./papers`: an ever-growing list of papers I came across; lost a few along the way
- `./homework`: code and submission for all the non-copyrighted homework
