# A reading list for my MPhil at Tinbergen Institute

---

## Purpose

This is my reading list for stuff I am gonna read, mostly related to math and economics, during my Master. The structure and all should follow [my other reading list](https://github.com/NoFishLikeIan/read-this) so...
You might say:

And I'd say, no. So let's get going.

## Structure

The structure should be as follows:
