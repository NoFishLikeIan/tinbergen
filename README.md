# A reading list for my MPhil at Tinbergen Institute

---

## Purpose

This is my reading list for stuff I am gonna read, mostly related to math and economics, during my Master. The structure and all should follow [my other reading list](https://github.com/NoFishLikeIan/read-this) so...
You might say:

> Use twitter like everybody you idiot - Random stranger

And I'd say, no. So let's get going.

The structure should be as follows:

- [ ] [_Title with hyperlink to paper/blog_](https://example.com/) - Short description, _Personal thoughts_ / [_Extra hyperlinked material_](https://example.com)

## Reading list

### Courses

- [ ] [_Logic for economists_](https://www.coursera.org/learn/logic-for-economists) - _Suggested course on logical foundation for economic reasoning_

### Papers

- [ ] [_Fiscal source of inflation_](https://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/john.cochrane/research/papers/decomposition.pdf) - This paper measures the fiscal roots of inflation, _This could be interesting in the scope of combining my thesis work (that focuses mostly on monetary policy and prices) to fiscal policy_

- [ ] [_The Complexity of Computing a Nash Equilibrium_](https://people.csail.mit.edu/costis/journal_ver10.pdf) - Is there a polynomial-time algorithm for computing Nash equilibria? And is this reliance on Brouwer inherent? _It is hard to compute for more than 2 players, that might be a problem for microeconomics, some hope in [gradient methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.12363)_
 
## Exercises

### Principles of Programming in Econometrics

- [ ] [_Exercise 0_](http://personal.vu.nl/c.s.bos/ppectr17/exer/e0_elim.pdf).pdf - Python basics and syntax
